a= 10
b = 4
# print(a//b) #floor division 
# print(a/b) #exact division

# to directly write code in terminal just write python
#to come out of that control+D

# print(a is b)
# print(a is not b)
# print(a == b)


# if a is not b:
#     print("true")
# else:
#     print("false")

# a = True #yaad rakhiyo ki True ka T capital hai
# b = False

# print(int(a))
# print(b)


# print(a is b  or a is not b) #direct or and likh do

# print (a>b and a is b) relational operator
